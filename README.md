# raustinpong
This is an attempt at a pong clone. It was primarily an attempt to explore animation using canvas, and the implementation of websockets. There are some issues with hiccups whenever the ball bounces due to the client predicting when the bounce happens, and the server communicating when there is a bounce. It does what it needs to, but pales in comparison to the real thing.
